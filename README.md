## 🎨 Pattern Drawing with DDA & Bresenham Algorithms

A **Java Swing** project that demonstrates two classic computer graphics algorithms — **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)** and **Bresenham’s Line Algorithm** — with creative line styles like **dotted, dashed, thick, and solid**.  
The program draws a **stylized pattern** consisting of rectangles and a diamond using these styles.

---

## ✨ Features
✔️ Draw lines using **DDA Algorithm**  
✔️ Draw lines using **Bresenham’s Algorithm**  
✔️ Supports multiple styles:
- 🔵 Dotted  
- 🟢 Thick  
- 🔴 Dashed  
- ⚫ Solid  

✔️ Simple GUI with Java Swing  
✔️ Easy to run and extend

## 🖼️ Pattern Overview
When you run the program, the output looks like this:

- 🔵 **Outer Rectangle** → DDA, Dotted style  
- 🟢 **Inner Rectangle** → DDA, Thick style  
- 🔴 **Diamond Shape**   → Bresenham, Dashed style

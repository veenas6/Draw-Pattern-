# Pattern Drawing using DDA & Bresenham Algorithms

This Java Swing program demonstrates **line drawing algorithms** (DDA and Bresenham) with different line styles (dotted, thick, dashed, and solid). It draws rectangles and a diamond with custom styles.

## Features
- **DDA Algorithm**
  - Dotted lines
  - Thick lines
- **Bresenhamâ€™s Algorithm**
  - Solid lines
  - Dashed lines
- Customizable line styles
- Simple Swing-based GUI

## Pattern Description
When you run the program, you will see:
1. **Outer Rectangle (Blue, DDA, Dotted)**  
2. **Inner Rectangle (Green, DDA, Thick)**  
3. **Diamond (Red, Bresenham, Dashed)**
